# Loan Approval Prediction System

![Project Banner](assets/banner.jpeg)


## 🧠 Overview
This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict whether a loan application will be **approved** or **rejected** based on a variety of applicant-related parameters. It simulates how a financial institution might use data to make faster and more accurate loan decisions.

---

## 📊 Business Relevance
Loan approval processes can be slow, biased, or inconsistent. This system provides a **data-driven approach** to improve decision-making by identifying key patterns in past approvals and rejections.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techieemike/loan-approval-prediction-system.git
   cd loan-approval-prediction-system




📌 Roadmap
✅ Load and inspect dataset

✅ Handle missing values

✅ Perform feature engineering

✅ Train multiple classifiers

✅ Evaluate best-performing model

⏳ Add model explainability (SHAP)

⏳ Deploy as a Streamlit dashboard or REST API
